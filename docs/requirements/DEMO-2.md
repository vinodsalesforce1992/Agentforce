# DEMO-2: View Client Portfolio Risk Score on Account

## Summary

View Client Portfolio Risk Score on Account

## Description

As a wealth advisor

I want to see each client's portfolio risk score on their Account record

So that I can quickly assess their investment risk exposure
The risk score should be calculated automatically based on their portfolio positions and categorized as Low, Medium, High, or Critical.

## Acceptance Criteria

When I open a client's Account record, I can see their Portfolio Risk Score (0-100)
I can see their Risk Category displayed clearly (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
I can see when the risk was last assessed
I can set a custom risk threshold for each client
I can create portfolio positions for the client with asset type, value, and risk weight
The risk score updates automatically based on the portfolio positions I add
