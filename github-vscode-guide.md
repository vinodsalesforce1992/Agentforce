# Connecting GitHub to VS Code

## Required Extension

The primary extension you need to connect GitHub to VS Code is the **"GitHub"** extension. This extension provides the core functionality for working with GitHub repositories directly in VS Code.

## Installation Steps

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X)
3. Search for "GitHub"
4. Install the extension by GitHub (official extension)

## How to Connect GitHub to VS Code

### 1. Authentication

- Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P)
- Type "GitHub: Sign in to GitHub"
- Follow the authentication flow in your browser

### 2. Clone a Repository

- Open the Command Palette
- Type "Git: Clone"
- Enter the GitHub repository URL
- Select a local folder to clone into

### 3. Working with Repositories

Once connected, you can:

- View and manage branches
- Commit changes
- Push and pull from GitHub
- View commit history
- Manage pull requests

## Key Features

- **Repository Management**: Clone, push, pull, and manage repositories
- **Authentication**: Secure sign-in with GitHub credentials
- **Pull Requests**: Review and manage pull requests directly in VS Code
- **Branch Management**: Switch between branches easily
- **Commit History**: View and interact with commit history

## Alternative: GitHub Pull Request Extension

The extension you already have installed (`github.vscode-pull-request-github`) is specifically for managing pull requests and is very useful for collaborative development workflows.

## Using Git in VS Code

Even without the GitHub extension, you can use basic Git functionality:

- VS Code has built-in Git support
- You can initialize repositories, commit, and push using the Source Control panel
- The GitHub extension enhances this with additional features

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Make sure you're signed in to GitHub
2. Check that your repository URL is correct
3. Verify your internet connection
4. Try restarting VS Code

## Best Practices

- Keep your GitHub extension updated
- Use the integrated terminal for advanced Git commands
- Regularly sync your local changes with GitHub
- Use branches for feature development
